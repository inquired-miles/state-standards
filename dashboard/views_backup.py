# The functionality has been refactored into modular views in the views/ package
# Keep this file for rollback purposes if needed during transition

# To restore original functionality if needed:
# 1. Rename this file back to views.py
# 2. Remove the views/ package
# 3. Update urls.py to use the old import pattern
